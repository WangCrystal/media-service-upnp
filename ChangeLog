version 0.2.0
	- Completed implementation of Upload.  It is now possible to
	  upload files to remote DMSs, both to specific directories and to
	  the AnyContainer ( if it is supported by your DMS ) .  Methods
	  have also been added to allow clients to cancel uploads and to
	  monitor their progress.

	        https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/43
	- New properties have been added to provide more information about
	  media objects exposed by DMSs.
	  - DLNAManaged indicates which actions can be performed on an object,
	    e.g., upload, delete, etc.
	        https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/36
          - Creator which indicates the creator of the content.
          - Artists which is an array of all the artists who worked on the
	    object.
          - CreateClass which identifies the type of objects that can be
	    created in a given container.
	        https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/45
	- The com.intel.UPnP.MediaDevice interface exposes some additional
	  properties that inform clients about the optional features supported
	  by DMSs.  These include:
          - DLNACaps indicating the DLNA OCM operations supported by the server.
          - FeatureList containing the list of features, e.g., BOOKMARK, EPG,
	    supported by the server.
          - SortCaps and SortExt Caps indicating the sorting capabilities of the
	    server.
          - SearchCaps indicating the searching capabilities of the server.
	         https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/24
	- Some new methods and properties have been added to
	  com.intel.UPnP.MediaDevice for ContentSync:
          - The System ID property
                 https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/38
          - GetSystemResetToken
	         https://github.com/01org/media-service-upnp/issues/46
        - The method com.intel.MediaServiceUPnP.PreferLocalAddresses has been
	  added.  This is useful for writing DMCs.  It allows DMCs to instruct
	  media-service-upnp to favour remote addresses.
