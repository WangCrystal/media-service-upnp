* Remove request bottleneck  (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 All requests from all clients are placed in a queue upon reception
 and their execution is serialized.  This was done initially to keep
 things simple and easy to debug but it introduces an unnecessary
 bottleneck which could become apparent when there are multiple
 clients.  This is unfortunate as the whole raison d'etre for
 media-service-upnp is to efficiently support multiple control
 points.

 For example let's suppose client 1 sends a request to server 1 and
 client 2 sends a request to server 2.  Under the current
 implementation client 2's request is not sent to server 2 until
 client 1's request has completed.  This delay is unnecessary as
 client 2's request can be sent before client 1's has completed,
 without causing any problems.  How best to resolve this situation has
 yet to be determined.  We could have a separate queue for each server
 or simply no queues at all as servers should be able to handle
 multiple simultaneous requests from the same control point.  Perhaps
 both configurations might be possible.  The former may prove to be
 useful in debugging.

* Implement local searching (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 media-service-upnp should detect when a server does not support
 searching.  In such cases it should implement the searching locally.
 Note that a server may support searching but not on the key that a
 client wishes to search on.  In this case local searching can also be
 used.  Media-service-upnp will need to define and document a fixed
 set of searching criteria that it supports.  This way clients will
 always know which searches can be performed.

* System Bus (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 Is the session bus the right bus for us?
